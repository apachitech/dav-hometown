# Visit Kinshasa - Your Guide to Kinshasa's Vibrant District

Visit Kinshasa is a simple and responsive website that serves as a guide for exploring Kinshasa's vibrant district.
This is the step 4 of Intro to Digital Course by CYF [ Code Your Future ] . I would be grateful if someone could review my code.
It features information about local activities, including shows, concerts, parks, sports, and a personal tour guide.
